About
-----
This project serves as an all-in-one project for various Cocoa classes and demonstrations put together by *balthisar.com*, and consists of several different themes with not a whole lot in common between them.

How to Use
----------
In XCode 5 or above the sample code is organized logically, as it is in the actual directory structure. Each demonstration code directory has its own readme.md file.

To run a demonstration program select the build target desired from the build scheme popup menu, which (as of XCode 5) is near the upper-left of the XCode main IDE window.
